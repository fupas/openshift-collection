# openshift-collection

A collection of great and usefull open source applications, deployed on Red Hat OpenShift. 

A lot of OSS projects already provide either docker containers, docker-compose support or Helm charts for deployment on Kubernetes, but almost none are ready to be deployed on OpenShift. As OpenShift is Kubernetes you therefor can use Help to deploy the apps, there are better ways to do this the "OpenShift-way".
